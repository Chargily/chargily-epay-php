Integrate ePayment gateway with Chargily easily.
- Currently support payment by **CIB / EDAHABIA** cards and soon by **Visa / Mastercard** 
- This is a **PHP package**, If you are using another programing language [Browse here](https://github.com/Chargily/) or look to [API documentation](https://github.com/Chargily/epay-gateway-php/blob/master/README_API.md)

# Requirements
1. PHP 7.2.5 or later. 
2. Get your API Key/Secret from [ePay by Chargily](https://epay.chargily.com.dz) dashboard for free.

# Installation
1. Via Composer (Recomended)
```bash
composer require chargily/epay-gateway
```
2. Download as ZIP
We do not recommend this option. But be careful to download the updated versions every a while [Download](https://github.com/Chargily/epay-gateway-php/releases/)
# Quick start

1. create config file **epay_config.php**
This is where store your api credentials

```php
//  Configurations file
return [
    'key' => 'your-api-key', // you can you found it on your epay.chargily.com.dz Dashboard
    'secret' => 'your-api-secret', // you can you found it on your epay.chargily.com.dz Dashboard
];
```
2. create payment redirection file **redirect.php**

```php
use Chargily\ePay\Chargily;

require 'path-to-vendor/vendor/autoload.php';

$epay_config = require 'epay_config.php';

$chargily = new Chargily([
    //credentials
    'api_key' => $epay_config['key'],
    'api_secret' => $epay_config['secret'],
    //urls
    'urls' => [
        'back_url' => "valid-url-to-redirect-after-payment", // this is where client redirected after payment processing
        'webhook_url' => "valid-url-to-receive-payment-informations", // this is where you receive payment informations
    ],
    //mode
    'mode' => 'EDAHABIA', //OR CIB
    //payment details
    'payment' => [
        'number' => 'payment-number-from-your-side', // Payment or order number
        'client_name' => 'client name', // Client name
        'client_email' => 'client_email@mail.com', // This is where client receive payment receipt after confirmation
        'amount' => 75, //this the amount must be greater than or equal 75 
        'discount' => 0, //this is discount percentage between 0 and 99
        'description' => 'payment-description', // this is the payment description

    ]
]);
// get redirect url
$redirectUrl = $chargily->getRedirectUrl();
//like : https://epay.chargily.com.dz/checkout/random_token_here
//
if($redirectUrl){
    //redirect
    header('Location: '.$redirectUrl);
}else{
    echo "We cant redirect to your payment now";
}
```
3. create payment processing file **process.php**

```php

use Chargily\ePay\Chargily;

require 'path-to-vendor/vendor/autoload.php';

$epay_config = require 'epay_config.php';

$chargily = new Chargily([
    //credentials
    'api_key' => $epay_config['key'],
    'api_secret' => $epay_config['secret'],
]);

if ($chargily->checkResponse()) {
    $response = $chargily->getResponseDetails();
    //@ToDo: Validate order status by $response['invoice']['invoice_number']. If it is not already approved, approve it.
    //something else
    /*
        $response like the follwing array
            $response = array(
                "invoice" => array(
                            "id" => 5566321,
                            "client" => "Client name",

                            "mode" => "EDAHABIA",
                            "invoice_token" => "randoom_token_here",
                            "due_amount" => 10000,

                            "updated_at" => "2022-01-01 06:13:00",
                            "back_url" => "https://www.mydomain.com/success",
                            "new" => 1,
